---[ Files ]---

// This tool can be used to recurse through a JAMMAN folder
// downloaded from the DigiTech JAMMAN and organize all the poorly
// named loop files so that they resemble the folders that they
// are kept in. Specifically:
//    JAMMAN/LOOPNN/LOOP.WAV <-- JAMMAN/LOOPNN/LOOPNN.WAV
//    JAMMAN/LOOPNN/LOOP.XML <-- JAMMAN/LOOPNN/LOOPNN.XML
// The file directory structure is intact, though that may be
// a possible next direction for this project in learning ruby.
jamman_organize.rb

// A directory to test the jamman_organize script on full of dummy files
JAMMAN

// A copy of the original dummy so that I can run the script and
// modify all the files then clone the unmodified one
JAMMAN_cp

// Getting off the ground with some test programs
hello_world.rb
rename_file.rb
dir_files_rename.rb

// Test files for the above test programs
